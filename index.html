  <p>What does <strong>OpenRSTS</strong> stand for?</p>
  <p>This is an idea I've had for over 7 years. I kept wanting to get it started, but I hadn't been able to get it past the thinking stage. Though recently the idea is starting to get a bit more concrete, so I decided it might be the time to really start implementing it. That's why this page is finally up, after having owned this domain for a while.</p>
  <p><i>So, what does it actually stand for?</i></p>
  <p>Sorry, you'll have to use your imagination for now. :)</p>
